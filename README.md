# work-day-scheduler
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation? To create a work day scheduler that keeps track of tasks and changes task color based on time of day. 
- Why did you build this project? I wanted to build a project that used third party API's to incorporate into javascript and styling. 
- What problem does it solve? This project allows users to keep track of their daily tasks and visually notifies them if their task has passed, is current, or in the future. 
- What did you learn? I learned to use bootstrap for styling, moment.js to create variabes using different time formats, and jquery to shorten javascript commands.
